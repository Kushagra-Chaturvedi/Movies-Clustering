# Movies-Clustering
Clustering Movies based on their Plots
## About:
<p>There are some movies we like, some we don't. Most people have a preference for movies of a similar genre. Some of us love watching action movies, while some of us like watching horror. Some of us like watching movies that have ninjas in them, while some of us like watching superheroes.</p>
<p>Movies within a genre often share common base parameters. Consider the following two movies:</p>
<p><img style="margin:5px 20px 5px 1px; height: 250px; display: inline-block;" alt="Interstellar" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51H4jXmToqL._SX300_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg">
<img style="margin:5px 20px 5px 1px; height: 250px; display: inline-block;" alt="Gravity" src="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/gravity_2.jpg"></p>
<p>Both movies, <em>Interstellar</em> and <em>Gravity</em>, are movies based on space exploration. Both are marvellous movies and share a good amount of similarity. One could conclude that both of these fall into the same genre of movies based on intuition. In this notebook, I have quantified the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb and Wikipedia, then separate them into groups, also known as clusters. I created a dendrogram to represent how closely the movies are related to each other.</p>
